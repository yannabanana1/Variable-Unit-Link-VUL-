        <h2>What is Variable Unit Link Life Insurance?</h2>
        <p>Variable Unit Link Life Insurance, often abbreviated as VUL, is a type of life insurance policy that combines a death benefit with investment options. It allows policyholders to invest their premiums in various investment funds, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The cash value of the policy can fluctuate based on the performance of the chosen investments.</p>

            <li>Flexibility: VUL policies often allow flexibility in premium payments and investment choices.</li>
            <li>Risks: Because the policy's cash value is linked to investments, there are investment risks involved, and the cash value can go up or down.</li>
        </ul>
